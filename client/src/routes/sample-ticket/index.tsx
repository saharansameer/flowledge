    description: `I've been trying to connect to my PostgreSQL database from my local dev environment. 
The credentials are correct, and the database server is running, but the connection always times out. 
Iâ€™ve tried restarting the server and checking firewall settings, but nothing works.`,
    summary:
      "The user cannot connect to their PostgreSQL database despite valid credentials and server availability.",
    helpfulNotes: `This issue could be related to network configuration or missing database bindings. 
Recommend checking that PostgreSQL is listening on the correct port and address (e.g., 0.0.0.0), and that the pg_hba.conf file allows the user's IP range. 
Also, verify that local firewalls or security groups (if on cloud) are not blocking traffic.
